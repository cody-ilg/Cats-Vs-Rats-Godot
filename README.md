# Cats Vs. Rats

A tower-defense rougelite made in Godot 4.4. My intentions with this project are to deliver a polished, well-scoped product while refining my coding skills/practices and learning pixel art. 


## Learning Objectives

My main goal for this project is to add a software project to my portfolio. While learning a new language (GDScript), I will refine my process and prove my flexibility. The MVP is reasonable while pushing myself and well-polished. To achieve these goals, I will implement and build on the tools and methods I used with success at Dev Academy.

#### Documentation and Planning
In previous projects, I have found that extensive planning and documentation helps stay on track and within-scope. I will achieve this by first scoping the project, then creating tickets for each step and feature. Using a Kanban board to track my progress. 

#### Git (Version Control)
This project is split into a Dev branch and main branch. The Main branch will contain the current build with complete features. The dev branch is for implementing the current ticket using regular commits. By keeping strict version-control, I will increase my comfortability with git.

#### Godot
By creating a project outside of the taught Dev Academy stack, I will prove that I can adapt what I know into learning different languages and frameworks. Godot's proprietary language GDScript, while based on Python, is not directly useful for web development but applies the same principles as any other object-oriented scripting language. 

#### Pixel Art
While not relevant to web development, I am making all original art assets for Cats Vs. Rats. I enjoy the creative side of programming, and learning how to make my own assets will increase my creative input on the project. 

## MVP

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
